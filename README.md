# space_race-analysis

This project is a part of my certification course, 100 days of Python from Udemy!
This project is a data science oriented project and I chose to work on this because of my interest in data analysis and data science.

I was provided with a jupyter notebook containing questions and a csv file that contains huge ammount of data on which I performed data analysis.
This project required the use of pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly.express, iso3166, datetime, timedelta.
